# React boilerplate

React boilerplate is a super minimal, unopinionated [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) boilerplate with minimal [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) configuration (that you can actually read and understand). It comes with all the basic features such as linting and hot reloading using web-pack-dev server.

## Features

* React
* ES6 (es2015) using babel
* Linting using eslint

## Installation

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```

## CLI

* `npm start` starts the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and start working on your project
* `npm run lint` lints your .js files
* `npm run build` builds/bundles your app at the `./dist/bundle.js`

## TODO

* Hot reload HTML as well (maybe use HtmlWebpackPlugin)
